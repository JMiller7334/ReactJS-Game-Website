# React Game Website
## Overview:
This is a rebuild of my game website project that
was orignally designed using HTML, CSS/SCSS, and Javascript. This is a direct clone of that website, but designed using React.Js with a heavy focus object oriented programming.

### Notes:
+ All site content(text) contained in dedicated files to creates highly readable code.
+ Object Oriented Programming concepts applied to React components to reduce the amount of code.
+ Tab/topic based website - Through OOP practices React only generates the necessary HTML for the content requested by the user.

### Project Goals:
+ Practice and gain a better understanding of React.Js.
+ Apply object oriented programming to a website.
+ Improve my skills in writting highly readable and maintainable code.
